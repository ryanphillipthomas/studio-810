# studio810

Autonomous development repository for **wearestudio810.com** — an umbrella organization containing multiple sub-applications. The first is **Connect**, a web app extending later to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Connect's design system *extends* the studio810 design system: shared fundamentals, distinct identity.

This repository is built so that work can enter from a GitHub Issue, a manual invocation, or a grok bot — and flow through a role-based bot pipeline (Chief → Product → Research → Design → Engineer → QA) that produces reviewable, drift-free pull requests. **Bots build; humans merge.**

## Map

| Path | What lives here |
|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Operating manual — start here if you are a bot or a new human |
| [`docs/sources-of-truth.md`](docs/sources-of-truth.md) | The canonical home for every concern, and the handoffs between them |
| [`docs/pipeline.md`](docs/pipeline.md) | How a run flows through the roles, with an artifact at every stage |
| [`docs/triggers.md`](docs/triggers.md) | How each of the three trigger sources invokes the pipeline |
| [`docs/drift-gate.md`](docs/drift-gate.md) | The design-drift fail-safe: what drift is, how it is measured, how it blocks |
| [`docs/roles/`](docs/roles/) | Role definitions: inputs, outputs, handoff contracts |
| [`pipeline/contracts/`](pipeline/contracts/) | JSON Schemas for every role-to-role handoff artifact |
| [`pipeline/runs/`](pipeline/runs/) | Auditable per-run artifacts, committed on run branches |
| [`design/`](design/) | Figma manifest + extracted design tokens (parent `studio810`, child `connect`) |
| [`packages/design-studio810/`](packages/design-studio810/) | Parent design-system package |
| [`packages/design-connect/`](packages/design-connect/) | Connect's design system — extends `design-studio810` |
| [`apps/connect/`](apps/connect/) | The Connect web app (scaffolded by the pipeline in Phase 2) |
| [`tools/drift-check/`](tools/drift-check/) | The drift-gate CLI run on every pull request |
| [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) | The trigger surface: pipeline, nightly research, drift gate |

## Sources of truth (summary)

- **Design** → Figma (via the Figma MCP), mirrored into `design/tokens/`
- **Tickets** → GitHub Issues in this repository
- **Development** → this repository
- **Deployment & previews** → Render (`render.yaml`)

## Quick start

- **File a ticket:** open a [Build request](../../issues/new?template=build-request.yml) issue — the `pipeline:build` label fires the pipeline.
- **Run manually:** `gh workflow run pipeline.yml -f prompt="build me this idea"`
- **Grok bot:** POST a `repository_dispatch` event of type `grok-build` (see [`docs/triggers.md`](docs/triggers.md)).

Every run lands as a draft PR with its artifacts under `pipeline/runs/<run-id>/`. The drift gate must pass and a human must review before anything merges.
